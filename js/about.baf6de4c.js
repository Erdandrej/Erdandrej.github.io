This research project presented a thorough analysis of the Digimon Card Game and how mechanics interact with or influence human psychology.

He progressed iteratively to build the game, improving the features along the way to deliver a complete game experience with automated gameplay systems and the physical maintenance present in the card game. From the beginning, Andrej was focused on what he wanted to work with during the project and was well organized in planning his work.
