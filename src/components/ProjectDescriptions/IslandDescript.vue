            My Game Design and Technology Master Thesis Project at the University of Gothenburg made in collaboration with our partners at <strong>FunRock and Prey Studios</strong>.
            This is a prototype for a cooperative multiplayer sandbox game, published in the Fortnite client, designed as a research vehicle to explore how game mechanics can encourage players to self-organize into cooperative role hierarchies within an open-ended, minimally guided sandbox environment. 
            The core gameplay revolves around survival, resource management, crafting, and exploration activities that inherently benefit from task specialization and team coordination.
            Thanks to the Fortnite Creator Program, this game is capable of generating revenue.

            The players, all members of a crew, have crashed-landed their spaceship on a deserted island due to technical malfunctions.
            Unfortunately, they are quickly made aware of the fact that after a specified amount of time, a meteor will hit this island, which they can see clearly in the sky, getting closer by the minute.
            Now they need to work together to find a way to fix their spaceship with materials found on the island to escape in time and survive, with no instructions whatsoever on how to do so.
            The goal of the game concept is to foster emergent behavior by requiring players to collaboratively discover game systems, divide responsibilities, and organically adopt roles such as gatherers, crafters, explorers, and leaders.
            The environment includes diverse biomes, a layered crafting system, and time-constrained gameplay loops that further encourage team strategy and coordination.

            Some noteworthy game features include <strong>scalable real-time cooperative multiplayer for large quantities of concurrent players</strong>, <strong>a substantial custom open-world map with diverse biomes that guide player progression organically</strong>, <strong>a responsive third-person controller for character movement</strong>, <strong>melee weapons for the gathering of materials</strong>,
            <strong>ranged weapons with accurate aiming for fighting off enemies and hunting wildlife</strong>, <strong>spawning of AI-controlled non-playable characters as wildlife and hostile enemies</strong>, <strong>resource nodes that give custom resources when hit</strong>, <strong>crafting stations used to create new items</strong>, 
            <strong>buildable structures that serve as a base of operation for players</strong>, <strong>craftable items that can be either used as survival tools or for further crafting</strong>, and <strong>an inventory system for organizing gathered materials and crafted items</strong>.

            My responsibilities included overseeing the overall design and technical architecture of the game, designing the player progression and gameplay loop, and implementing all gameplay-related systems and mechanics using UEFN tools, such as the crafting system, base building, resource node gathering, NPC spawning and behavior, loot drops, and environmental obstacles.
            Additionally, I was in charge of utilizing the cinematic sequencer to create animations for building structures and the meteor.
