            As a group project for the Game Engine Architecture course of my MSc program, our team decided to implement a C# based game engine that supported voxels.
            <br><br>
            Although limited in function because of the scope of the course, this game engine is capable of successfully generating and rendering a substantial amount of voxels, 
            as well as rendering and shading traditional mesh-based 3D models. Additionally, it also has the functionality of positionally aware adaptive audio.
            <br><br>
            My main responsibilities for this project were to <strong>implement the baseline 3D rendering engine</strong> and to create an <strong>algorithm for importing 3D models</strong>.
