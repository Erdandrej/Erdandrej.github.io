            Spellwright's Armageddon is a board game resulting from a group project in the Gameplay Design course of my MSc.
            It is a custom 3D-printed multiplayer board game that allows players to take on the role of wizards, 
            creating geometrical patterns on a board to cast elemental spell cards and overcome their adversaries.

            Each turn, players draw different colored runes representing different elements from a common stash and can then place these on a shared mana pool to create 
            sigil shapes based on the spell cards that have in their hand. The mana pool board is comprised of multiple moving pieces, thus the players can use a plethora of metamagic
            spells available to all to alter the position of runes on the board in different ways in order to create unexpected sigil shapes and cast spells to damage their opponents.
