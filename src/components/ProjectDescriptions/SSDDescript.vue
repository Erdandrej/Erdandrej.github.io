            A group project realized in six weeks, this Godot game is an endless runner arcade game where the player is a USB stick hover car
            that tries to escape from cybersoviet software to save the day. It features a unique vaporwave aesthetic and mixes 2D Sprites with 3D models to create a unique visual style.

            The main mechanic is a holographic shield that the player can rotate in order to reflect projectiles back to enemies. In addition to reflecting projectiles, 
            the shield can also absorb the shots by being rotated and can then shoot the projectiles back by standing still. The player has to manage this shield while 
            evading obstacles and surviving the attacks of three possible enemy types.

            The game features a <strong>2D-player controller</strong>, <strong>AI Enemies with 3 possible variants</strong>, <strong>custom 2D sprites and 3D models</strong>,
            <strong>procedurally generated background terrain</strong>, <strong>story cutscenes and recorded dialogue</strong> and <strong>VCR TV style post-processing effects</strong>.

            My responsibilities included overall game design, art direction, programming the player controller and the shield and projectile mechanics, and creating sound effects.
