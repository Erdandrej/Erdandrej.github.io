            A group project realized in 2 months, this Unity game is an atmospheric horror-adventure game where the player controls an antique submarine and is 
            tasked by a mysterious company to retrieve a set of artefacts at the bottom of the ocean in the sunken remnants of an ancient civilization.
            It features a striking retro aesthetic and a unique control scheme where the player interacts with every function of the submarine physically with their mouse by turning valves, 
            pushing levers and clicking buttons.

            During the player's exploration to find these hidden artefacts, they have to handle various submarine malfunctions while also avoiding mythical sea creatures that are lurking in the water.
            In order to make navigation in the environment easier and more immersive, the player has access to a sonar and screens that display camera footage from the hull of the submarine.
            There is a deep malfunction repair system implemented where the player needs to solve puzzles to repair specific mechanical aspects of the submarine depending on the damage suffered by the vehicle.

            Some noteworthy game features include a <strong>first person controller</strong>, <strong>physical control surfaces</strong>, <strong>custom submarine underwater physics</strong>,
            <strong>an extensive quest and objective system</strong>, <strong>custom shaders for underwater effects and stylized materials</strong>, <strong>procedurally animated monsters</strong>, <strong>a deep malfunction puzzle-solving system</strong>, 
            <strong>atmospheric and reactive 3D audio</strong>, <strong>a large and detailed level with distinct areas</strong>, <strong>readable physical books that organically guide and immerse the player</strong>, and <strong>machinery animated with inverse kinematics</strong>.

            My responsibilities included overall game design, level design and implementation and programming gameplay systems in C# such as the camera systems for in-game interactable VCR screens, game progression, 
            the quest system, collectible artefact system, the player-bounds system for organically limiting player movement and a minefield spawning system implemented with Poisson-Disc sampling.
