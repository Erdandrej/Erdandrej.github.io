            A group project realized in around a month, this Unity augmented reality mobile application serves as a proof of concept for a game product that allows players to bring physical collectible trading cards to life in AR and build customizable mechs with them.
            Each of these unique physical cards represents its own mechanical robot part, such as different types of weapons and chassis, all with different attributes and gameplay characteristics. 
            By combining these components in strategic ways, players can then control these custom mechs to fight off against waves of hostile robot enemies in an AR mini-game.

            By scanning these different cards through their phone camera, their associated mechanical parts appear on the card, reacting to its physical movements.
            Through this system, players can build custom mechs in real time by positioning their desired mechanical components next to compatible sockets in physical space.
            If two different components have matching socket types, they will magnetize together, allowing the construction of a unique mecha one part at a time.
            The primary objective of this framework is to enable players to collect cards of varying rarity through booster packs, providing them with a wide range of component options for each category, which allows for endless mech customization and gameplay possibilities while also encouraging physical trading among players.

            Some noteworthy game features include <strong>real-time image tracking of custom physical cards</strong>, <strong>using physical actions to interact with virtual objects</strong>, <strong>augmented reality gameplay through touch controls on a mobile device</strong>, <strong>customizable mech chassis with customizable weapon sockets and an automated turret</strong>, <strong>4 different weapon types with unique gameplay characteristics, damage profiles, particle effects, and dynamic sounds</strong>, <strong>an automated weapon aim system that predicts enemy movements and projectile trajectories</strong>, and <strong>custom 3D CAD models for all assets in the game</strong>.

            My responsibilities included overall game design, ideation of the product concept of bringing cards to life through mixed reality, implementing the interchangeable mechanical part socket system, and the technical implementation of all augmented reality systems of the game, including image tracking, mobile device tracking, virtual plane creation according to physical card placement, and the spawning and anchoring of virtual objects in physical space.
            Additionally I have also created some of the 3D weapon models using CAD software.
