            A fully automated fan-made trading card game simulator made in Unity for the Digimon Card Game that allows players to matchmake online or play against AI opponents with their own custom decks.
            Our remote team is comprised of developers from all around the world.
            <br><br>
            This simulator fully implements and automates over 3000 cards, each with their own unique card effects and interactions, with hundreds of new cards being released every few months.
            It aims to keep up with the release schedule of the physical card game it simulates and allows players to test decks against each other or AI opponents and enjoy the game online.
            <br><br>
            Some noteworthy features of this project include:
            <strong>full automation of every game mechanic and rule present in the card game</strong>,
            <strong>automated card effects for every card in the game</strong>,
            <strong>worldwide server-based matchmaking</strong>, 
            <strong>option to fight an AI opponent</strong>,
            <strong>dedicated deckbuilder with automated importing</strong>, 
            <strong>fully customizable assets for the play area</strong>,
            <strong>custom animations and sound effects</strong>,
            <strong> an extensive options menu</strong>, and a <strong>mac version</strong>.
            <br><br>
            I contribute to this project as a gameplay programmer using C#. 
            My responsibilities include implementing new cards, their unique card effects, all gameplay systems surrounding them, and 
            programming new game mechanics never seen before in the game. Every few weeks, I bugfix older problematic cards to uphold the quality of the product and satisfy our players.
