            A group project submission for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/ixd-gdt-spooky-game-jam" target="_blank">Spooky Game Jam 2023</a> made over 48 hours based on the theme "possesion".
            It features a crow protagonist named "Crowley" trying to collect as many shiny coins as possible in a Halloween themed city while evading other evil crows. It won the "most fun" award.

            The main draw of this game was the flight controls of Crowley, with proper acceleration and deceleration based on altitude and pitch. 
            The game asks the player to collect as many coins as possible under a timer while evading and ever increasing swarm of evil crows and even a boss crow, once the player finds a rare cursed coin.

            The game features a <strong>3D flight controller</strong>, <strong>custom flight physics</strong>, <strong>random city environment generation</strong>,
            <strong>AI enemy behaviour and crowd physics</strong>, and a <strong>boss enemy</strong>.

            My responsibilities included overall game design, and programming enemy behaviours and systems.
