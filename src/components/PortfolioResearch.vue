                        My BSc thesis work from the Delf University of Technology, this empirical research study consisted of measuring the performance of a specific AI method, 
                        Propensity Score Matching, compared to other methods for determining causality in various data sets by changing their inherent unconfoundedness.

                        an AI agent-based virtual model that simulates the behavior of crowds in airport terminals in order to optimize their layout.

                            This report provides concrete guidelines on how to design character class systems in games by proposing an academically 
                            sound definition and supporting it through acknowledged game design patterns and quoting existing research in the field.

                        This case study I did with a colleague examines the consequences of "power creep" in the Digimon TCG and how it affects the psychology of its players. 
                        The results were achieved by interviewing and surveying a large part of the dedicated community.
