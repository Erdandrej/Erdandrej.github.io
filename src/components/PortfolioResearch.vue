                        My MSc thesis work from the Game Design and Technology program at the University of Gothenburg.
                        This research thesis explores how sandbox game mechanics can be designed to foster emergent, community-driven cooperative behavior among players, particularly through the organic formation of role hierarchies. 
                        The project combines academic research on game design theory, psychology of player motivation, and multiplayer community dynamics with iterative design and empirical playtesting. 
                        It aims to contribute practical design guidelines for future games seeking to cultivate deep social interaction and self-sustaining player communities that extend beyond the sum of their individual mechanics.

                        My BSc thesis work from the Computer Science and Engineering at the Delf University of Technology. 
                        This empirical research study consisted of measuring the performance of a specific AI method, Propensity Score Matching, compared to other methods for determining causality in various data sets by changing their inherent unconfoundedness.

                        This case study I did with a colleague examines the consequences of "power creep" in the Digimon TCG and how it affects the psychology of its players. 
                        The results were achieved by interviewing and surveying a large part of the dedicated community.
